# Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid Robot

The capstone project integrates all concepts learned in the previous modules to design and implement an autonomous humanoid robot. This project demonstrates the application of ROS 2, digital twins, AI, and VLA models in a complex robotic system.

## Overview

In this capstone project, you'll design and implement an autonomous humanoid robot that can navigate environments, recognize objects, respond to voice commands, and perform complex manipulation tasks. This project synthesizes knowledge from all previous modules.

## Topics in this Module

- [Humanoid Robot Integration](./topic-1)
- [Autonomous Behavior Implementation](./topic-2)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this capstone project, you will be able to:
- Integrate all components from previous modules into a unified system
- Implement autonomous navigation for humanoid robots
- Design behavior trees for complex robotic tasks
- Validate the system in simulation environments

## Prerequisites

- Complete understanding of all previous modules
- Proficiency in ROS 2 and simulation environments
- Knowledge of AI and machine learning for robotics
