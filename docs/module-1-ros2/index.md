# Module 1: ROS 2 – Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the first module of our AI Robotics Textbook. In this module, you'll learn about ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the nervous system for robotic applications.

## Overview

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

## Topics in this Module

- [Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture](/docs/module-1-ros2/topic-1)
- [ROS 2 Nodes and Topics](/docs/module-1-ros2/topic-2)
- [ROS 2 Services and Actions](/docs/module-1-ros2/topic-3)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes
- Implement communication between nodes using topics, services, and actions
- Build basic robotic applications using ROS 2

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
