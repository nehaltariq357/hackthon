# Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) provides a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's designed to support the development of complex robotic applications with features like distributed computing, real-time support, and deployment in embedded systems.

## Core Architecture Concepts

ROS 2 uses a distributed architecture where multiple processes (potentially on different machines) can communicate with each other through a publish-subscribe messaging pattern. The key components include:

- **Nodes**: Basic compute units that execute ROS programs
- **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
- **Actions**: Asynchronous goal-oriented communication
- **Parameters**: Configuration values that can be changed at runtime
- **Lifecycle nodes**: Nodes that have well-defined states and transitions

## Creating a Basic ROS 2 Node

Here's a simple example of a ROS 2 Python node:

```python title="minimal_publisher.py"
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class MinimalPublisher(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_publisher')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10)
        timer_period = 0.5  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
        self.i = 0

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = 'Hello World: %d' % self.i
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info('Publishing: "%s"' % msg.data)
        self.i += 1

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    minimal_publisher = MinimalPublisher()
    rclpy.spin(minimal_publisher)
    minimal_publisher.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Key Differences from ROS 1

ROS 2 addresses several limitations of ROS 1:

- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Configurable reliability and durability settings
- **Security**: Built-in security features for authentication and encryption
- **Real-time support**: Better real-time capabilities for time-critical applications
- **Multiple DDS implementations**: Support for different middleware implementations
- **Improved cross-compilation**: Better support for embedded systems

## Practical Exercise

Create a simple ROS 2 package with a publisher node that publishes sensor data and a subscriber node that processes this data.

## Summary

ROS 2 provides a robust foundation for developing complex robotic applications. Its distributed architecture and rich ecosystem of tools make it ideal for both research and production robotics applications.
