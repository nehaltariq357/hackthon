# Module 2: Digital Twin – Gazebo & Unity

In this module, you'll explore digital twin technologies for robotics, focusing on Gazebo and Unity simulation environments. Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical systems that enable testing and validation before deployment.

## Overview

Digital twin technology allows roboticists to create virtual replicas of physical robots and environments. This enables extensive testing, validation, and optimization of robotic systems in a safe, controlled environment before deployment on real hardware.

## Topics in this Module

- [Gazebo Simulation Environment](/docs/module-2-digital-twin/topic-1)
- [Unity Integration for Robotics](/docs/module-2-digital-twin/topic-2)
- [Digital Twin Concepts and Applications](/docs/module-2-digital-twin/topic-3)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Integrate Unity with ROS 2 for advanced visualization
- Create digital twins of robotic systems
- Perform testing and validation in simulation environments

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of ROS 2 (from Module 1)
- Understanding of 3D visualization concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments
